Build an AI agent that:
a. Searches for ‘smart fan’ on Google/YouTube/Instagram/X (you can choose
only one or multiple platforms)
b. Goes through the top N search results (N to be determined and justified by
you)
c. Quantify the Share of Voice (SoV) that Atomberg gets in the search results.
You need to come up with a metric that you feel best represents the SoV.
Some directional pointers:
i. Mentions in the post/comments for Atomberg vs. competition
ii. Engagement for posts that mention Atomberg vs. Competition
iii. Sentiment analysis and identification of Share of Positive Voice
